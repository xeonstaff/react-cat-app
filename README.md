## Idea

This app was comissioned by Mr. Curtis Durham. Ideation goes to him.

Design ideation entirely original. All custom CSS.

## Data
Cat pictures - cats as a service: 
http://thecatapi.com/

Cat names-- rare names from US census data
https://namey.muffinlabs.com/

Owner info: Random User
https://randomuser.me/


## Tools
Material UI

Cat loading icon from Evgeny Marinin via Lottiefiles:

## Future Directions
This app had a pretty low bar ('show cat pictures'), so for the first time, I think I've actually exceeded expectations.

/but/ the image loading isn't as clean as I'd like it to be-- the lottie
needs to last until the image renders, not just until it loads 

## Learning
New things in my skillset:
1. more APIs than I've ever used in a single app
2. first use of .ts on a non-code-along project
3. first use of lazy loading to more cleanly render fake cat age (~immediate),
fake cat name (fast), and cat picture (slow)
4. first time using the useContext hook-- there's no reason for it, really 
(it's a tiny app and would require passing 1 prop down 2 levels) but I'd like to
master the remaining React hooks
